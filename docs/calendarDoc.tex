\section{Supplementary specification}
	The supplementary specification is structured using the FURPS+ model.
	\\ \\
	\textbf{Functionality:}
	The program should support a minimum of functions.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The functions should support sharing of calenders, creation and modification of events and viewing.
	\item The functions should be intuitively grouped.
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Usability:}
	The user should be able to use the program with as little knowledge as possible, which raises the following requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The user should consider a minimum of options performing the desired task. This may compromise both performance and functionality.
	\item Anyone beyond the age of 12 should be able to understand the program terminology. 
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Reliability:}
	The program should be very reliable, even if it compromises security. Any error should result in recovery or crash, neither involving the user. Any crash or recovery must maintain the content of the database.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The program should be able to complete as many tasks as possible without internet connection.
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Performance:}
	The program should have reasonable performance. Since it does not rely on any time expensive operations, no supplementation is needed.
	\\ \\
	\textbf{Supportability:}
	Functions should be supported with a help page. The content should be limited because the intuitiveness and limited functionality makes it needless.
	\\
