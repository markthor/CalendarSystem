\section{Supplementary specification}
	The supplementary specification is structured using the FURPS+ model.
	\\ \\
	\textbf{Functionality:}
	The program shall support a minimum of functions.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The functions shall support sharing of calenders, creation and modification of events and viewing.
	\item The functions shall be intuitively grouped.
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Usability:}
	The user shall be able to use the program with as little knowledge as possible, which raises the following requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The user should consider a minimum of options performing the desired task. This may compromise both performance and functionality.
	\item Anyone beyond the age of 12 shall be able to understand the program terminology. 
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Reliability:}
	The program shall be very reliable, even if it compromises security. Any error should result in recovery or crash, neither involving the user. Any crash or recovery must maintain the content of the database.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The program shall be able to complete as many tasks as possible without internet connection.
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Performance:}
	The program shall have reasonable performance. This means that no operation shall take more than 2 seconds on a bandwidth with more than 2 mBit/s and a processor of more than 1 GHz.
	\\ \\
	\textbf{Supportability:}
	Functions shall be supported with a help page. The content should be limited because the intuitiveness and limited functionality makes it needless.
	\\ \\
\section{Operation Contracts}
	\textbf{Operation:}	newEvent(time:Date, description:String)
	\\ \\
	\textbf{References:}	User Cases:	Create new event
