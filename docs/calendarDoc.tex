\section{Supplementary specification}
	The supplementary specification is structured using the FURPS+ model.
	\\ \\
	\textbf{Functionality:}
	The program shall support a minimum of functions.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The functions shall support sharing of calenders, creation and modification of events and viewing.
	\item The functions shall be intuitively grouped.
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Usability:}
	The user shall be able to use the program with as little knowledge as possible, which raises the following requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The user shall consider a minimum of options performing the desired task. This may compromise both performance and functionality.
	\item Anyone beyond the age of 12 shall be able to understand the program terminology. 
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Reliability:}
	The program shall be very reliable, even if it compromises security. Any error should result in recovery or crash, neither involving the user. Any crash or recovery must maintain the content of the database.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The program shall be able to complete as many tasks as possible without internet connection.
	\\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Performance:}
	The program shall have reasonable performance. This means that no operation shall take more than 2 seconds on a bandwidth with more than 2 mBit/s and a processor of more than 1 GHz.
	\\ \\
	\textbf{Supportability:}
	Functions shall be supported with a help page. The content of the help page should be limited because the intuitiveness and limited functionality makes it needless.
	\\ \\
\section{Discussion of software attributes}
	The system shall support a limited selection of functions. This decision makes it is easier to get an overview of the functionality for the novice user. This converge with our usability requirement, because users with limited knowledge will benefit from this. Security hinders usability, as it is harder to use a system that requires user authentication. The system has this trade-off because it is a minimum for supporting cloud computing. The program could involve the user in eventual errors, but this has been deselected to make it simpler. Only connectivity errors that users have a chance to solve will return an error. All of the decisions match our priority of making the system usable with as little knowledge as possible.
\section{Operation Contracts}
	\textbf{OC 1} \\
	\textbf{Operation:}	newEvent(time:Date, description:String)

	\textbf{References:}	User Cases:	Create new event
	\\ \\
	\textbf{Pre Conditions:}	
	\begin{itemize}	
					\item	User must be connected to the server
					\item must be logged on to the system
					\\ \\
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Post Conditions:}	
	\begin{itemize}	
				\item	An Event instance event was created (instance creation)
				\item	event.ID is uniqe (Primary key established)
				\item	event is associated with a Calendar, based on the users ID (association formed)
				\item	event.description becomes description (attribute modefication)	
					\\ \\	
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{OC 2} \\
	\textbf{Operation:}	updateEvent(event:Event, command:String)
	\\ \\
	\textbf{References:}	User Cases:	Edit event, Delete event
	\\ \\
	\textbf{Pre Conditions:}
	\begin{itemize}	
				\item	User must be connected to the server
				\item	User must be logged on to the system
				\item	An exitsing Event must be selected
	\\ \\	
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Post Conditions:}
	\begin{itemize}	
				\item	The incomming command has been executed on the target Event (instance modification)
				\\ \\
	\end{itemize}
